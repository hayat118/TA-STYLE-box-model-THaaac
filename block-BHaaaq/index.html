     <div class="B6">The Ganges (Ganga) River is a sacred body of water to Hindus that
        begins high in the Himalaya Mountains and empties out into the Bay of Bengal.
         The surrounding river basin has a population of more than four hundred million people.
         The Ganges River originates in the Himalaya Mountains at Gomukh, the terminus of 
         the Gongotri Glacier. When the ice of this glacier melts, it forms the clear waters 
         of the Bhagirathi River. As the Bhagirathi River flows down the Himalayas, 
         it joins the Alaknanda River, officially forming the Ganges River.</div>
