   <h1>River Ganga</h1>
     <div class="box">
       <p>The Ganges (Ganga) River is a sacred body of water to Hindus that begins high in the 
     Himalaya Mountains and empties out into the Bay of Bengal. The surrounding river basin 
     has a population of more than four hundred million people.The Ganges River originates in 
     the Himalaya Mountains at Gomukh, the terminus of the Gongotri Glacier.
      When the ice of this glacier melts, it forms the clear waters of the Bhagirathi River. 
      As the Bhagirathi River flows down the Himalayas, it joins the Alaknanda River, officially 
      forming the Ganges River. </p></div>
